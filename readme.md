### Orbital Mechanics Simulator

This project is supposed to simulate orbits using real world orbital mechanics equations and formulas in (somewhat) simple ways

# Description

This project serves as a simple (yet accurate.. to a degree) orbital mechanics simulator, which I developed as part of my GAM340 module during my time at Falmouth University.

Whilst it's not finished, it features many of the original features that I wanted when I set out my Statement of Intent when the project began. So, to that extent please keep in mind that the project is unfinished, and may never get finished regardless of my own personal plans for it (which are to keep working on it)

Features:

- Simulated Newtonian Gravity, which allows for complex orbits.
- An in-depth statistics window that shows the state of the simulation at any point in time
- Simulation tools for editing, adding, moving, and deleting the various celestial bodies and objects in the simulation.
- Orbit previews and a "live update" mode that will attempt to calculate the orbits as the planets move (WIP)


Known Bugs/Issues:

- "Live orbit" mode gives erroneous results, that don't match the originally predicted orbit.
- When selecting a planet using the edit tool, sometimes you have to click an object twice for it to actually be selected
- After placing a body using the "add" tool, setting the velocity doesn't work
- Settings menu is blank

For a more in-depth look at the development, find the Trello board here: https://trello.com/b/XngKKkMS/orbital-mechanics-simulator

For planned features, it's best to look the Trello as that will be the most up-to-date place.

Thanks for playing! Please feel free to give me some feedback or if you find a bug I'd appreciate you leaving a comment letting me know how to reproduce it :)
